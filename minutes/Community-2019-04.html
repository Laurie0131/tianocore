<b>License Updates</b>


<p>The license change commit is scheduled for April 9th. Any concerns should be raised ASAP.</p>

<p>Mike Kinney is updating the Wiki with the <a href="https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/38979">new info</a>.</p>


<b>Groups.io Transition</b>


<p>Moving to the new mailing list for devel will happen next week. Send any questions / comments to <a href="mailto:stephano.cetola@linux.intel.com">Stephano</a>.</p>


<p>We will wait a few weeks before transitioning the "edk2-bugs" mailing list over.</p>


<b>Code Columns: 80 vs 120</b>


<p>80 is the standards, so we are going to stick with that. Jordan will tweak the documentation to be more clear and update the PatchCheck.py script to reflect this idea.</p>


<b>UEFI Plugfest - Seattle</b>


<p>The UEFI plugfest will be happening this month. For those attending feel free to ping Stephano. We will most likely be having some TianoCore meetups to discuss the project.</p>
